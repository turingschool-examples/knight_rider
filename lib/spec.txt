Using Ruby code, create a simple HTML page that displays a header "Knight Rider Cast" and lists the three characters with their name, actor, description, age, and a photo of their headshot. You will need to write HTML that somehow interacts with the Ruby objects you've created. There are several viable tactics for doing this.

Hint: you will need to research tactics and experiment with them to get this work.
